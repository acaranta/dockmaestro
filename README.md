dockmaestro
===========

a container to work with maestrong

let's say you have a maestrong configuration named /fu/bar/myconf.yml

if you want to start this on a docker host without install python and its pip modules :
```
docker run --rm -t -i -v /fu/bar/myconf.yml:/conf/conf.yml acaranta/dockmaestro <start/stop/status/clean>
```
or, if the myconf.yml is in the current dir :
```
docker run rm -t -i -v $(pwd)/myconf.yml:/conf/conf.yml acaranta/dockmaestro <start/stop/status/
clean>
```

What it does is the equivalent of :
```
maestro -f /conf/conf.yml <your> <parameters>
```

Please see https://github.com/signalfuse/maestro-ng for more options/configuration.
